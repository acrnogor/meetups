# ZgPHP meetup hosting guidelines

Thank you for your interest to host ZgPHP meetup, we're thankful for your support.

## Space

ZgPHP usually attends 20-50 members. It's recommended to have at least 30 seats in the room where the meetup will be held. 
Let us know if you're limited with space, so that we can set RSVP limit on Meetup.com and Facebook events.

Let us know upfront if there are any special info we need to communicate (e.g. required ID cards at the entry desk).

## Equipment

Please double check that your equipment works and let us know if we need to bring something that's missing.

### Mandatory
- Projector with HDMI
- Working Wi Fi (and password!) and Internet connection

### Optional
- Microphone and speakers
- Presenter / clicker / pointer

## Host pitch

There will be planned 2-5 min. slot for your "pitch". Ask someone from engineering department 
(e.g. tech lead, head of development) to tell us a story about your company - what do you do, how do you do it, what are
challenges you're facing on a daily basis, what kind of developers you're hiring etc.

Try to avoid HR and sales pitchesas our members are 99.9999% developers and our meetups are development-oriented.

## Talk

When you're hosting meetup we suggest you to organise one full talk slot (25-45 min). 
This is a nice way to introduce your company to our members.

## Office tours

Some of our hosts are organising office tours for atendees to explore your offices. 
If that sounds like a good idea, feel free to organise the tour before and/or after the official part of the meetup.

## Snacks and drinks

If you want you can provide snacks and drinks prior/after the meetup. Usually people are more eager to stay and network with
others if there is pizza included, but that is not a requirement for hosting a meetup :)

## General rules
- We do not tolerate harrassment of any kind, please read our code of conduct.
