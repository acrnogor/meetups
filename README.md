# ZgPHP meetups

This repository contains information about upcoming and past ZgPHP meetups. 
Use this repo to submit talks ideas, requests for hosting ZgPHP meetup and planning organisation of meetups.

## Venues

We love to organize meetups at different companies. To ensurre fairness and transparency, applications for
hosting our meetups will be handled through pull requests in this repository.

If you want to host ZgPHP at your company, create a pull request with one markdown 
file targeting meetup directory that represents the meetup (i.e. the month) you're interested
in talking at. For example, If you want to give a talk on **ZgPHP Meetup in July, 2020.**, 
create PR with `foo-company.md` file in `meetups/2020/07` directory.

First PR has priority over others, so make sure to create PR as soon as you decide to host a meetup and book your slot.

We don't have strict rules and limits on hosting our meetups, the more the merier. 
However, we'll be fair and allow everyone interested to host a meetup.
