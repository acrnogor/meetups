# Code of conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and others (i.e. everyone) at our events are required to agree 
with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. 
We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

**tl;dr: Be excellent with each other**

## Need Help?
Leading up to the event, please contact us via email or twitter and we'll do our best to address your concerns.

During the event, please contact any of the staff, they will introduce themselves at the beginning of the event.

## The Quick Version
Our meetup group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). 
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is 
not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. 
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the 
discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, 
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, 
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, 
including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, 
please contact an organizing staff immediately.

Staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, 
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the 
event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at event venues and event-related social events.
